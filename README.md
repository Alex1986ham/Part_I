# To do, before submiting a repo

- Add docstrings to each 'class' and each 'def'
- Check the whole document through 'POP8 online' for identation and so on


# HTML and CSS Skills

IDs for example in <p id="something"> could be used just once in a webpage.

In this example:

<p class="highlight module right"></p>
.right {
color: green;
}

The class will be changed in color. Because its enought that the class just contains the word right.

# Positioning in CSS

## Inline-Block
- box-sizing: border-box; for sizing the border box
- display: inline-block; for sizing a span inline block (it positions elements in one line, but not if two divs are positions under each other
- position: relative; The relative flow is a variant of the normal flow and behaves basically the same. But, the relative flow adds some new abilities.
In case of this:
'
.shift {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
  left: 10px;
}
'
position: relative; change the position of the box to top 10px and left 10px

## Position fixed

position: fixed; this element will be always in the viewpoint of the user, use this especially for navigation tools

Right! You only need position: fixed and bottom: 0px to make a sticky footer!

In the case of position: absolute, the element is positioned relative to its parent before the rest of the normal flow occurs. Its siblings in the normal flow ignore it and are laid out as if it were not there. Frankly, position: absolute is best thought of as a last resort. If all the other flows fail, then maybe absolute is your best option. Off the top of my head, I can't actually think of an instance where I wanted to use position: absolute. 
Transform is a better solution to absolute: here is a link to it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform

## Inline Formatting

Horizontal alignment starts with another property, direction, which has two options: ltr and rtl. Besides that, use text-align left, right, and center.

vertical-align: text-top, vertical-align: text-bottom and vertical-align: middle are options for aligning text to the eponymous locations in the parent.

vertical-align: top and vertical-align: bottom will align with the line instead.

### CSS properties:
- display
- position
- text-align
- vertical-align

## Floats inside of a container

.left {
      float: left;
     
With overflow: auto, the "new context" element respects the boundaries of the two children. No overlap! Try toggling overlap: auto to see what happens if it isn't applied.

clear: left indicates that the top of the element must be below any left floated elements that appear before this one in the document. clear: right acts the same, but with right floated elements. clear: none means that there are no restrictions; this is the default value.

  .bordered {
      border: 2px solid #2e3d49;
    }
    .left {
      float: left;
      background-color: #FD9F0E;
    }
    .right {
      float: right;
      background-color: #FD9F0E;
    }
    .clear-left {
      clear: left;
    }
    .clear-right {
      clear: right;
    }
    .clear-both {
      clear: both;
    }
    .wide {
      width: 40%;
    }
  </style>

  ## Setting a Viewport
  
  It's important to set a viewport to make a page scaleable to different devices. This code should be implemented in the head:
  
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  
  always use wide: 100% to make images according to the screen used.
  Use wide: 100% especially for images and videos like this:
  
  img, embed, object, video {max-width: 100%;}
  
  ## Making Buttons big enough to be clicked on smartphone
  
  nav a, button {min-width: 48px; min-height: 48px;}
  
  also add a padding for each a tag:
  
  padding: 1.5em;
  Remember code always from small to large screen.
  
  ## Adding media query
  
  <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width:500px)" href="over500.css">
  
  in th over500.css write this:
  body {background-color: blue;}
  
  A link to a separate css file is one possiblity to solve that problem. An other solution might be to use @media.
  The advantage of @media is that when loading the page fewer http request are needed, because the css file is just bigger and	don' have to much css files.
  
  Example:
  
  @media screen and (min-width: 500px) {boady { color: #F79420;}}
  
  @dedia screen and (min-width: 800px){body {background-color: blue;}
  
  <style type="text/css">
      h1 {
        position: absolute;
        text-align: center;
        width: 100%;
        font-size: 6em;
        font-family: Roboto;
        transition: all 0.5s;
      }

       body{
    	background-color: green;
          }
          @media screen and (max-width: 400px) {
              body {background-color: red; }
          } 
           @media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
               body {background-color: blue; }
          }
          
    </style>
  
  
  ## Breakpoints
  
  Adding breakpoints is neccessery to make it suitable to different screens.
  
  ## Flexbox
  
  width: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  
  Putting an order to all css elements:
  header { width: 100%; order: 1; }
  .red {width: 50%; order 2;}
  .gree {width: 50%; order 3;}
  footer {width: 100%; order: 3;}
