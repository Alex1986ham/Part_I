# Terminal operations

- cd
- cd ..
- pwd
- ls
- ls -l dropbox/*.pdf
- mkdir (creates a new directory somewhere)
- mkdir dropbox/new
- mv (moving documents from one directory to an other) example: mv info.txt new/ (will move the txt file to the folder new
- curl http://google.com (shows the html file in terminal
- curl -o google.html -L http://google.com (creates an html file in current directory)
- cat dictionary.txt (reads all the content of the file diectionary.txt)
- less dictionary.txt (reads all the contet but much better to read)
- inside of less use /goobers (to search for the word goobers
- rm dictionary.txt (removes the file without questioning)
- rm -i dictionary.txt (removes with questioning)
- remdir terribleDirectory (removews directory)

- grep shell dictionary.txt (check if a word is in the file, word search for is shell)
- grep shell dictionary.txt | less (same as before just one page)
- curl -L https://tinyurl.com/zeyq9vc | grep (search inside of the site for a particular wordk without saving it somewhere)
- curl -L https://tinyurl.com/zeyq9vc | grep fish | wc -l (as before, to count how many searches where found)
- curl -L https://tinyurl.com/zeyq9vc | grep -c fish (same as before, just an other way)

# Git 

## Types of different git commands:

- git init (creates space in the directory for the git repo)
- git clone link (gets the repo in the current working directory)
- git status (gives the status of the current repo)
- git log (displays information about the existing commits)
  - git log --oneline (shows shorter information about all commits)
  - git log --stat (shows information about changed files)
  - git log --patch (or) git log -p (shows very detailled information about any changes in the files)
  - git log -p fdf5493 (will start showing at a particular SHA and all the previous commits)
- git show (diesplays the info abou the last commit)
- git show fdf5493 (shows info about a particular commit and nothing lese (by default it shows -p)) 
    git show could be combined with --stat / -p / -w

## Putting all files to staging aread, from where they could be commited

- git add index.html (puts the file to the staging aread)
- git rm --cached index.html (removes the file from the staging area back to nomrmal repo)
- git add . (adds all existing files to the repo)
- git commit (to commit changes through atom, atom will be opend)
- git commit -m "initial commit..." (will make a commit with the text initial commit)

### Writting commit messages

Do

- do keep the message short (less than 60-ish characters)
- do explain what the commit does (not how or why!)

Do not

- do not explain why the changes are made (more on this below)
- do not explain how the changes are made (that's what git log -p is for!)
- do not use the word "and"
  - if you have to use "and", your commit message is probably doing too many changes - break the changes into separate commits
  - e.g. "make the background color pink and increase the size of the sidebar"
Checkout udacity standards of making commits: https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/

- git diff (shows the uncommited changes in comparison to the last commit)
- touch test.txt (adding a document to the current directory)
- by adding a file .gitignore all files in this directory will be ingnored by commits to the repo


### Taggin

- git tag -a v1.0 -m "1st version" (creates a tag to the current commit, exmpl. version or something)
- git tag (displays just all tags existing)
- git tag -d v1.0 (for deleting a tag / git tag --delete works also)
- git tag -a v1.0 a87984 (will add a tag to a past commit)

### Branching

- git branch (If we type out just git branch it will list out the branches in a repository)
- git branch sidebar (will add a new branch named sidebar to the repo)
- git checkout sidebar (changing to the branch sidebar)
- git branch beta-version 42a69f (will create a new branch at a specific commit)
- git branch -d sidebar (will delete the branch sidebar, but first need to change to master)
- git branch -D sidebar (this is a hard deleting of a branch, which has commits on it, which aren't available in an other branch)
- git checkout -b footer master (does 2 things in one: creates under master a new branch named footer)
- git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all (seeing all versions on all branches)

### Merging

- git merge <name-of-branch-to-merge-in> (beeing in masters branch a sidebar branch will be merged to master branch)
- git reset --hard HEAD^ (turns a merge back)

### Undoing changes

- git commit --amend -m "..." (to update the most-recent commit instead of creating a new one)
- git revert <SHA-of-commit-to-revert> (When you tell Git to revert a specific commit, Git takes the changes that were made in commit and does the exact opposite of them)
- git reflog (You've got to be careful with Git's resetting capabilities. This is one of the few commands that lets you erase commits from the repository. If a commit is no longer in the repository, then its content is gone.
To alleviate the stress a bit, Git does keep track of everything for about 30 days before it completely erases anything. To access this content, you'll need to use the git reflog command. Check out these links for more info)

- git reset <reference-to-commit> (The git reset command is used to reset (erase) commits)
  it could be used to...:
    - move the HEAD and current branch pointer to the referenced commit
    - erase commits
    - move committed changes to the staging index
    - unstage committed changes
- git reset --mixed HEAD~1 (will move the last commit to working directory)
- git reset --soft HEAD~1 (will move the last commit to staging index)
- git reset --hard HEAD~1 (will move the last commit to trash, where it will be available for 30 days)
- git branch backup (before reset a commit, create a backup)
