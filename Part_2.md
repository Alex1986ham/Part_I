# Git 

## Types of different git commands:

- git init (creates space in the directory for the git repo)
- git clone link (gets the repo in the current working directory)
- git status (gives the status of the current repo)
- git log (displays information about the existing commits)
  - git log --oneline (shows shorter information about all commits)
  - git log --stat (shows information about changed files)
  - git log --patch (or) git log -p (shows very detailled information about any changes in the files)
  - git log -p fdf5493 (will start showing at a particular SHA and all the previous commits)
- git show (diesplays the info abou the last commit)
- git show fdf5493 (shows info about a particular commit and nothing lese (by default it shows -p)) 
    git show could be combined with --stat / -p / -w

## Putting all files to staging aread, from where they could be commited

- git add index.html (puts the file to the staging aread)
- git rm --cached index.html (removes the file from the staging area back to nomrmal repo)
- git add . (adds all existing files to the repo)
- git commit (to commit changes through atom, atom will be opend)
- git commit -m "initial commit..." (will make a commit with the text initial commit)

### Writting commit messages

Do

- do keep the message short (less than 60-ish characters)
- do explain what the commit does (not how or why!)

Do not

- do not explain why the changes are made (more on this below)
- do not explain how the changes are made (that's what git log -p is for!)
- do not use the word "and"
  - if you have to use "and", your commit message is probably doing too many changes - break the changes into separate commits
  - e.g. "make the background color pink and increase the size of the sidebar"
Checkout udacity standards of making commits: https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/

- git diff (shows the uncommited changes in comparison to the last commit)
- touch test.txt (adding a document to the current directory)
- by adding a file .gitignore all files in this directory will be ingnored by commits to the repo


### Taggin

- git tag -a v1.0 -m "1st version" (creates a tag to the current commit, exmpl. version or something)
- git tag (displays just all tags existing)
- git tag -d v1.0 (for deleting a tag / git tag --delete works also)
- git tag -a v1.0 a87984 (will add a tag to a past commit)

### Branching
